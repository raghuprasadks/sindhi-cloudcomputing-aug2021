	Sindhi College, Bengaluru was established in the year 2002, under the aegis of Sindhi Seva Samiti, a philanthropic organisation managed by the Sindhis with, "Service to Human kind" as their motto and was inaugurated by Sri.L.K.ADVANI the then Deputy Prime Minister of India and Sri.S.M.Krishna the then Chief Minister of Karnataka.

Since then, the growth of the Institution has been phenomenal and is recognised as one of the premier institutions not only in the city of Bengaluru but also among the other states of India. The college is permanently affiliated to Bengaluru City University. It is a self-financing, co-education college imparting quality education in the streams of Science and Commerce, offering UG and PG courses. The objective of the institution is to create an indelible mark on the canvas of higher education with a vision to expand the horizons in the realm of teaching-learning, wherein young talented students are groomed and transformed into thinkers, researchers and entrepreneurs seeking opportunities in the industry or academics.

The institution is making all out efforts to build confidence among the students to excel in academics, professional ventures and personal lives. The college is endowed with state-of-the-art infrastructure.
